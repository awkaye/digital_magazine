<h1> Building Healthy Digital Habits </h1>
<div>
<p class="introduction">Because social media is part of everyday life, teenagers must develop healthy digital habits. Without control, online activities can consume too much time and energy.
<br><br>One effective strategy is setting daily screen time limits. Monitoring usage helps teens become aware of how much time they spend online. Turning off unnecessary notifications reduces distractions and stress.
<br><br>Spending time on offline activities is equally important. Physical exercise, reading books, practicing hobbies, and bonding with family strengthen real-life relationships and improve overall well-being.
<br><br>Digital detox periods can also be helpful. Taking a break from social media for a day or even a few hours allows the mind to rest. It improves focus, sleep quality, and emotional balance.
<br><br>Parents and schools can support teenagers by encouraging healthy technology habits and open discussions about online experiences.
<br><br>Healthy digital habits create balance between online and offline life. Social media should support teenagers’ growth, not control it. With awareness, discipline, and responsibility, young people can enjoy technology while protecting their mental, emotional, and academic well-being.

<h1> Social Media and Mental Health </h1>
<div>
<p class="introduction">Social media has a strong influence on teenagers’ mental health. While it offers connection and entertainment, it can also affect how teens feel about themselves and their lives. Understanding this impact is important for maintaining emotional well-being.
<br><br>One major concern is comparison culture. Teenagers often see pictures of perfect bodies, expensive lifestyles, and exciting experiences. However, most of these posts are edited or carefully selected. Comparing real life to these filtered images can lower self-esteem and create feelings of insecurity.
<br><br>Excessive social media use can also lead to anxiety and sleep problems. Many teens stay up late scrolling through feeds or responding to messages. Lack of sleep affects mood, energy, and academic performance. Constant notifications may also increase stress levels.
<br><br>However, social media can also provide positive mental health support. Many pages promote self-love, motivational quotes, and mental health awareness. Support groups allow teenagers to share their struggles and feel understood. Online friendships can provide comfort and encouragement.
<br><br>Balance is important. Setting time limits and unfollowing negative accounts can reduce harmful effects. Choosing to follow positive and inspiring content can improve mood and confidence.
<br><br>Social media can both help and harm mental health. By being mindful of their online habits, teenagers can protect their emotional well-being and create a healthier relationship with technology.

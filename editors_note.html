<h1>📝 Note:</h1>
<p class="note">Social media has become a powerful force in the lives of teenagers today. 
From sharing daily experiences to building online communities, platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook influence how young people communicate, learn, and see themselves. 
While it offers opportunities for creativity and connection, it also presents challenges such as cyberbullying, comparison culture, and digital addiction.
<br><br>As students in the digital age, we must understand both the benefits and risks of social media. 
Awareness is the first step toward responsible usage. 
This issue aims to guide teenagers in building healthy online habits while still enjoying the advantages of being connected.</p>

<h1>Insights:</h1>
<p class="note">As a teenager myself, I see how social media can be both inspiring and overwhelming. 
It allows us to express ourselves, but it can also pressure us to meet unrealistic standards. 
I believe balance and digital responsibility are key to making social media a positive tool rather than a harmful distraction.</p>

<h1> The Dangers of Cyberbullying</h1>
<div>
<p class="introduction">Despite its benefits, social media also has serious risks. One of the most concerning issues among teenagers today is cyberbullying. Unlike traditional bullying, cyberbullying happens online, making it harder to escape and often more public.
<br><br>Cyberbullying includes sending threatening messages, spreading false rumors, posting embarrassing photos, or leaving hurtful comments on someone’s profile. Because posts can be shared quickly, harmful content can reach a large audience within minutes. This makes the impact even more painful for the victim.
<br><br>Teenagers who experience cyberbullying often feel emotional distress. They may feel embarrassed, anxious, or afraid to attend school. Some may isolate themselves from friends and family. Their academic performance may also suffer because stress makes it difficult to concentrate.
<br><br>Another problem is that cyberbullying can happen at any time. Unlike school bullying, which usually stops after class, online bullying can continue 24/7. Victims may feel like there is no safe place to escape.
<br><br>Preventing cyberbullying requires awareness and responsibility. Teenagers should think carefully before posting or commenting online. Schools should educate students about digital citizenship and encourage reporting harmful behavior. Parents should also communicate openly with their children about their online experiences.
<br><br>Cyberbullying is a serious issue that can cause emotional and psychological harm. By practicing kindness, respect, and responsibility, teenagers can help create safer digital spaces where everyone feels protected and valued.

<h1> Academic Performance in the Digital Age </h1>
<div>
<p class="introduction">Social media has changed the way students learn and interact in school. While it provides useful resources, it can also distract teenagers from their academic responsibilities.
<br><br>Many students struggle to focus on homework because of notifications and messages. Switching between studying and scrolling reduces concentration and memory retention. As a result, students may spend more time studying but learn less effectively.
<br><br>On the other hand, social media can improve learning when used correctly. Students can join online study groups where they share notes and explain lessons to one another. Educational videos make difficult subjects easier to understand. Teachers sometimes use social platforms to share announcements and reminders.
<br><br>Time management plays an important role. Creating a schedule for studying and setting phone-free periods can increase productivity. Using apps that block distractions during study time can also help students stay focused.
<br><br>When students learn to control their usage, social media becomes a helpful tool instead of a distraction.
<br><br>Social media has the power to either improve or harm academic performance. With discipline and responsible habits, teenagers can use digital tools to enhance their education and achieve their goals.

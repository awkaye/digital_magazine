<p class="intro">In this special issue, we take a closer look at how social media shapes the lives of teenagers in today’s world. 
Social media is no longer just a way to communicate, it has become a big part of our everyday routines. 
From chatting with friends to sharing photos and watching videos, teenagers spend many hours online. 
Because of this, social media strongly influences how young people think, act, and see themselves.
<br><br>In this magazine, you will discover how different platforms affect teenage identity, friendships, and self-esteem. 
Social media can help teens express their creativity, share their talents, and connect with people who have the same interests. 
It also provides access to news, educational content, and opportunities to learn new skills. 
However, it also brings challenges such as cyberbullying, comparison culture, peer pressure, and digital addiction. 
These issues can affect mental health, academic performance, and real-life relationships.
<br><br>This edition also includes expert insights, helpful tips for building healthy digital habits, and real-life stories that show why responsible online behavior is important. 
Our goal is to help teenagers understand both the benefits and risks of social media. 
By becoming more aware and mindful, young people can learn how to use technology wisely and create a healthier balance between their online and offline lives.</p>
